  {
    id: "NAV-01",
    category: "Navigation",
    title: "Non-sticky, Outdated Navigation Bar",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "The header is static, disappearing on scroll, with default alignment, poor contrast, and lacks clear focus indicator states.",
    whyBadUX: "Forces users to scroll all the way back to the top to navigate, creating friction and increasing bounce rates on long pages.",
    bestPractice: "Sticky navigation or smart-hide header that reappears on scroll-up. Clean glassmorphic background with 70% opacity, backdropped blur, active indicator trails, and custom interaction feedback.",
    exactSolution: "Implement a sticky `backdrop-blur-md` glass navigation with dynamic height adjustment on scroll, a subtle border-b, clearly highlighted CTA buttons, and keyboard tab focus outlines."
  },
  {
    id: "HERO-01",
    category: "Homepage",
    title: "Generic 'Hero' Banner and Weak Value Proposition",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "Generic stock imagery, vague claims of 'excellence', low contrast headline text over complex background, and secondary buttons of equal visual weight.",
    whyBadUX: "Fails to capture interest in the first 3 seconds. The user cannot quickly tell what makes AI INFOTECH different from thousands of other IT agencies.",
    bestPractice: "A clear, bold headline explaining target business value (e.g. 'We engineer elite software architectures for global enterprises'), dual distinct CTA weights (primary fill vs secondary outline), and motion-graphics representing tech-stack telemetry.",
    exactSolution: "Design a split-column hero featuring Space Grotesk typography, an interactive canvas background with floating tech illustrations, dual CTAs ('Schedule Strategy Call' and 'Explore Solutions'), and concrete statistics (e.g. '99.2% SLA Adherence') directly under the CTAs."
  },
  {
    id: "SERV-01",
    category: "Services",
    title: "Flat, Uninspired Service Cards",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "Services are listed in flat, static container grids with wall-of-text paragraphs, missing actionable 'Learn More' trails, and lacking interactive hover feedback.",
    whyBadUX: "Overwhelms users cognitively. Flat text blocks look lazy and outdated, discouraging users from exploring specific technical offerings.",
    bestPractice: "Bento-grid styled cards with custom SVG icons (rather than generic stock images), brief 2-sentence summaries, subtle gradient borders, and active hover scales with nested ArrowRight icon transitions.",
    exactSolution: "Create modular hover-responsive cards utilizing Framer Motion. Add dynamic border gradients (`hover:border-primary-500/50`), micro-interactions where icons translate or glow, and explicit modal sliders for service-specific technical blueprints."
  },
  {
    id: "TECH-01",
    category: "Homepage",
    title: "Static Text List of Technologies",
    impact: "Medium",
    currentProblem: "Technologies (Java, React, AWS) are either hidden or listed as simple bullet points or raw text, understating engineering capacity.",
    whyBadUX: "Fails to showcase modern technical capabilities to architects and engineering leaders, who scan for tech stacks visually.",
    bestPractice: "Interactive tech stack directories styled as high-contrast animated badges, categorized by domain (Frontend, Backend, Cloud, DevOps, Quality), with hover tooltips and official vector logos.",
    exactSolution: "Develop an interactive, animated horizontal ribbon or categorizable directory of tech badges. Implement tag-based filtering (e.g., 'Cloud & Infrastructure', 'Backend Core', 'Automation Testing') with micro-scaling animations."
  },
  {
    id: "CARE-01",
    category: "Careers",
    title: "Vague Hiring Process and Missing 'Life at Company' Section",
    impact: "Medium",
    currentProblem: "The current careers page features a simple generic text callout or static list of 'send resume here' email links. No culture statements, no benefits listed, no timeline of recruitment phases.",
    whyBadUX: "Deters top-tier talent. Elite candidates expect transparency in the hiring journey, clear workplace benefits, and evidence of a modern progressive culture.",
    bestPractice: "Provide a 4-step clear visual hiring timeline, explicitly enumerate key pillars of benefits (e.g., remote-first, learning budget, wellness allowances), and feature real-time searchable job boards with clear requirements.",
    exactSolution: "Integrate a recruitment center inside the SPA. Include an interactive culture slider, a modern grid detailing benefits with custom-styled icons, an animated recruitment timeline, and active role listings with instant interactive application modals."
  },
  {
    id: "CONT-01",
    category: "Contact",
    title: "Generic Contact Form and Missing Interactive Maps",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "Static standard forms with no client-side verification, generic success alerts, and text-only address lines that are difficult to locate.",
    whyBadUX: "High friction in lead generation. Users are unsure if the form actually submitted or when they will receive a response, leading to low conversion rates.",
    bestPractice: "Form with inline error validation, custom success dialogs, an explicit SLA promise (e.g. 'Response within 4 Business Hours'), and an interactive custom map highlighting international office nodes.",
    exactSolution: "Design a premium dual-pane contact hub. The left pane features rich contact data, office operating hours, and an interactive vector-drawn map node. The right pane features a multi-step validated form with skeleton-loading indicators and a clear SLA promise."
  },
  {
    id: "TYPO-01",
    category: "Typography",
    title: "Poor Font Choices and Lacking Visual Hierarchy",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "Standard default serif/sans fonts with generic sizes and low contrast ratios. Headings are small and indistinguishable from body text, leading to heavy visual fatigue.",
    whyBadUX: "Creates a cheap, unprofessional look. Poor typography breaks reader engagement and hides critical selling points.",
    bestPractice: "Carefully paired typography (such as Space Grotesk/Outfit for bold tech headings and Inter for optimal body legibility). Explicit mathematical line-height, kerning, and size hierarchy (e.g., h1: 4.5rem, body: 1rem).",
    exactSolution: "Apply 'Space Grotesk' for displays and 'Inter' for UI/Body. Introduce tracking-tight on headers, spacious leading on paragraph structures, and strict typographic hierarchy mapping to semantic tags."
  },
  {
    id: "COLOR-01",
    category: "Visual Identity",
    title: "Dull, Monotonous Color Palette",
    impact: "Medium",
    currentProblem: "Plain blues and grays without a consistent primary/secondary identity, making the visual look identical to generic late-90s templates.",
    whyBadUX: "Lacks brand recall. Does not convey modern tech leadership, energy, or elite engineering maturity.",
    bestPractice: "Develop a premium corporate theme: Deep Indigo primary, Electric Teal secondary, Dark Charcoal neutrals, and subtle soft-accent color tints with glowing radial highlights.",
    exactSolution: "Define a modern high-contrast color scheme (Deep Slate `#0F172A`, Electric Azure `#3B82F6`, Cyber Teal `#06B6D4`, Emerald `#10B981` success metrics). Implement custom radial light glows behind cards for a Vercel/Stripe-like depth."
  },
  {
    id: "PERF-01",
    category: "Performance",
    title: "Heavy Stock Images and Lack of Lazy Loading",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "Unoptimized heavy stock images that block initial page render. No asset preloading or layout shifts protection (missing width/height specifications).",
    whyBadUX: "High load times cause drop-offs, especially on mobile networks, destroying the conversion rate before the user even views the brand.",
    bestPractice: "Utilize lightweight vector illustrations, compress all images, implement lazy loading (`loading=\"lazy\"`), and set skeleton-placeholder grids for loading states.",
    exactSolution: "Replace stock images with sleek vector SVG animations and custom CSS illustration modules. Wrap all interactive components in dynamic skeletons and ensure responsive element ratios prevent layout shifts (CLS)."
  },
  {
    id: "ACC-01",
    category: "Accessibility",
    title: "Lack of Web Accessibility (WCAG Non-Compliance)",
    impact: "High",
    currentProblem: "Missing alt text on assets, low color-contrast text, non-semantic button tags, and complete lack of keyboard-navigation supports (no focus outlines).",
    whyBadUX: "Excludes users with visual/motor disabilities, creates legal exposure, and degrades general user experience for keyboard navigators.",
    bestPractice: "Strict compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Ensure minimum text contrast ratios of 4.5:1, implement proper focus states, use ARIA labels, and ensure full keyboard trap mitigation.",
    exactSolution: "Incorporate semantic HTML structures (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`). Add `aria-label` tags to all icon buttons, ensure focusable rings (`focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-primary-500`), and run regular contrast calculations."
